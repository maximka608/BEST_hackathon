### ‚ôø Inclusive Map API

FastAPI application for storing objects, commenting, and building accessible routes for people with reduced mobility (PRM) using OpenStreetMap data.

 ---

### ‚úÖ Features
‚úî Filter places by categories, such as convenience for visually impaired people or wheelchair accessibility, based on various factors like ramps, tactile elements, convenient entrances, accessible toilets, etc.

‚úî Build an optimal route, considering inclusivity filters.

‚úî Add reviews ‚Äî the ability to rate places and leave comments.

‚úî Regular users can suggest changes to the accessibility features.

‚úî Ability to add users with special needs.

‚úî Users with special needs have access to edit the accessibility features.

‚úî Responsive design

‚úî User-friendly and intuitive design


---
### Setup Database

run init_db.py to create your DB

run following command to init alembic:

```python
alembic init alembic
```

in alembic/env.py set your target_metadata as follows:
```python
from src.models import Base
target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

in alembic.ini change the connection string to your DB(run config.py to get your link)
```ini
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:////...ACTUAL_LINK_TO_YOUR_DB
```

to create migrations run:
```python
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create tables"
```

to apply migrations run:
```python
alembic upgrade head
```

### üõ† Tech Stack
FastAPI ‚Äî for creating REST APIs.

SQLLite + SQLAlchemy ‚Äî for storing objects and comments.

MongoDB ‚Äî for OpenStreetMap geodata.

NetworkX ‚Äî for building graphs and implementing the A* algorithm.

Pydantic ‚Äî for validation and serialization.

### üîß Project Configuration
The project uses environment variables to configure the database connection, authorization parameters, and CORS policy. A .env file is used to store sensitive information and should be created in the root directory of the project.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Parameters:
MONGODB_URL ‚Äì the connection string for MongoDB. If not provided, it defaults to mongo_url.

MONGO_DB_NAME ‚Äì the name of the MongoDB database (hackathon_lviv).

DATABASE_URL ‚Äì the path to a local SQLite database. It is automatically generated based on the location of the object.db file in the project's root directory.

SECRET_KEY ‚Äì the secret key used for signing JWT tokens.

ALGORITHM ‚Äì the algorithm used for JWT encryption (e.g., HS256).

ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES ‚Äì the lifetime of the access token in minutes (defaults to 120 minutes).

REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS ‚Äì the lifetime of the refresh token in days (defaults to 30 days).

origins ‚Äì the list of allowed CORS origins from which the API can be accessed. For example, http://localhost:3000 is used for frontend development.

### üîó Main Routes

### üîπ `/comments`

#### `POST /comments`
Add a new comment or rating to an object.

**Input Data (JSON):**
```json
{
  "object_id": "str",
  "text": "Optional[str]",
  "rating": "Optional[int]"
}
```

### üîπ `/comments/{object_id}` 
Get a list of comments for an object.
Returns an array of comments or a message "No comments found".

### üîπ `/ratings/{object_id} `
Get only the ratings for an object.
Returns an array of RatingResponse objects.


### üîπ `/find_path`
Find a route between two points using the A* algorithm.

**Input Data (JSON):**
```json
{
  "start": {"lat": float, "lon": float},
  "end": {"lat": float, "lon": float},
  "accessible": true | false
}
```
If accessible=true, the route considers restrictions for PRM: wheelchair, incline, kerb, surface, etc.
Returns a list of route coordinates or a message if no path is found.

--- 

### ‚öôÔ∏è A Pathfinding Algorithm*
- haversine(): calculates the distance between two coordinates.

 - calculate_accessibility_weight(): calculates the "difficulty" of the route for people with reduced mobility.

- build_graph(): creates a graph with weighted edges.

- astar_path(): finds the shortest (or most accessible) route

---

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- The application includes a robust authentication and authorization system to manage users, roles, and secure access to API endpoints.

#### User Registration and Login
- Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing a unique email and username. The system ensures that each email and username is not already registered.

- Sign In: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Upon successful authentication, the system issues an access token and a refresh token using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- Logout: Users can invalidate their tokens to securely log out from the system.

#### Token Management
- Access Tokens: Short-lived tokens used for authenticating user requests.

- Refresh Tokens: Long-lived tokens used to renew access tokens without requiring re-authentication.

- Tokens are stored and managed in the database to support secure logout and token revocation.

####  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system distinguishes between regular users and administrators.
- Promote regular users to admin status.
- Demote admins back to regular user roles.
- Promotion and demotion actions are protected and accessible only by authenticated administrators.

####  User Profile Management

- View their profile details.
- Delete their own account.


####  Security Highlights
- Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

-  All endpoints requiring authentication validate access tokens using JWT.

-  Sensitive admin routes are protected using custom dependencies that ensure the caller has admin privileges.
